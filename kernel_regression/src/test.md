### Linear independence of arbitrary n-slices of functions

When using Kernel methods, we will be evaluating functions at specific
locations given by the training data set, $ \{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n\} $, and
there is no way to know those locations in advance.  Fortunately, there are
functions which produce linearly independent n-slices, for any slice, and any
size $n$.  This gives the final space of functions the ability to fit any set
of target values $\{y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_n\}$.
